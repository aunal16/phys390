# phys390_eot_report
This repository includes MATLAB functions for plotting ionospheric plasma dispersion relations in unmagnetized and magnetized plasma, along with refractive-index surfaces.

For dispersion relations, L=1, MLAT=20 is used as the default configuration.
For refractive-index surface polar plots, L=4, MLAT=0 default is used.
